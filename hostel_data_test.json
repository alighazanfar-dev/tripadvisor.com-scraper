        "Review #1": "Such an amazing hotel. Paul is very nice and picturesque. The hotel is also quite close to everything / cantered. Me and my family loved it. I strongly recommend it for couples as it is very cute. Also, the receptionist was lovely so are all of the staff!",
        "Review #2": "Hotel is centrally located in the Opera district near Galleries La Fayette close to a number of train and metro stations, but is in a quiet street with lots of local business. We stayed at the 7th floor suite, which has great views of the top of Opera and Eiffel Tower which truly made it memorable. Didn\u2019t get to use the pool and steam rooms but heard it was excellent.  Staff were very attentive to our needs, especially as we are traveling with my elderly mom and 4 year old. They made our stay very special. Highly recommend and I\u2019ll likely stay here again or open to try another Astotel property next time.",
