        "Review #1": "This hotel is on a safe, small side street and has excellent noise insulation to the outside.  We stayed in a superior connecting room (with swing - nice touch!) which was spacious with huge beds. We also had a double room in addition.  This was pleasant enough. Reception staff are very pleasant. Huge tv with large choice of channels. Galimard bath products high smell lovely. New bathrooms which were very clean Excellent air conditioning which works and is super quiet. Separate toilet (very small and a bit claustrophobic) All in all a great choice for location, value, quiet and size of  superior rooms (large by Paris standards). Some points - Lots of attention to detail in the room with brushed gold light switches and sockets.  But then old silver handles on the bathroom doors which just clash! Not a big issue at all but it\u2019s as if lots of thought was put into some of the design but then not into others.  The circus theme decor is not to my taste, and doesn\u2019t go with the lovely blush and gold wallpaper in the bathroom. That\u2019s obviously just personal taste though, it has been nicely finished. - Very generous with the minibar in room, which includes plastic Evian bottles, glass juice bottles and cans.  Nowhere to separate this recycling in the bedroom - there is just one small bin under the desk where it is then mixed with all your other trash\u2026.so do they comb through it all by hand?!  Or maybe not! Refillable free water would be much more eco friendly. - Similarly in the bathroom there are large hand soap and body wash, but small plastic throwaway bottles of conditioner and shower gel. - Corridors felt a little cramped. - There were flies on the cakes at the free snacks during the afternoon - they are not covered, and really should be.",
        "Review #2": "Newly renovated hotel with great amenities and service in a great, safe neighborhood off a relatively quiet street. The elevator is big enough for guests and luggage. The room was thoughtfully designed with power switches and usb and c chargers on each side. The window had blackout curtains and opened up to a quiet courtyard. The beds and bedding were comfortable. The bathroom was cozy but laid out well and had a fan that quietly runs constantly which keeps the mirror from fogging after the shower. The lobby and dining area are nice and would be great for groups or families to relax together outside of their rooms. We didn\u2019t eat breakfast at the hotel but the evening snack bar was nice.",
